### background
- Low stock levels were a cause of frustration     
- users commented on the high levels of out of stocks. This could force users to shop elsewhere     

### objective
Adding a shop by size filter to appear as a sticky footer on the product listing page prompts the user    
to select their sizes earlier in the journey to avoid viewing products not in their size.    

#### a few notes
 var tmp=0;

 set interval 

 var sel = how many are selected = 0;

 if tmp == sel do nothing
 else
 tmp = el


 filter loop and deliver html
